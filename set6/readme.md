TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Since I didn't have class in Week 6, i focused to finalise my decision on which dataset to use for my research project. As I regularly use the light rail to get to university, I decided to focus my research on the usage of light rails in NSW to find out any interesting insights. While exploring the data, I found it interesting that the light rail system had been operating even before the introduction of the new L2 and L3 lines.
