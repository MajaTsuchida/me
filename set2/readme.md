TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
faced few issues while completing the exercises however, it worked at the end. Struggled to complete the star pyramid in Exercise 3, where some of my structure was similar to the answer but the codes were mixed up in the wrong order. Exercise 2 was interesting as i could learn how simple mistakes are often made. Struggled most while completing exercise 3 but I was able to figure it out at the end after discussing with others.
