TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I encountered a few issues while completing the exercises, but everything eventually worked out. I struggled with the star pyramid in Exercise 3, where some of my codes were close to the answer, but was mixed up and resulted in the wrong shape. Exercise 2 was interesting because it highlighted how easily simple mistakes can happen through typos. While Exercise 3 was the most challenging, I managed to figure it out after discussing it with others.
