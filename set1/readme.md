TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I completed downloading all the necessary software, including VS Code,ã€€ setting up the required accounts, and connected everything to my GitHub to be able to push my changes. I did encounter some issues and had to go through some trial and error with uninstalling and reinstalling, everything eventually worked out with a few attempts and support from others.
