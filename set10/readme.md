TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In class, we learned how to create presentations using the RISE format, and I successfully connected my files between VS Code and GitHub. I started by organizing all the necessary code, including graphs and maps, that I would use in the presentation. I feel I did well in creating headlines and shifting between slides using slide, subslide, and skip. I did face some issues where my code was too long, causing the graphs to be cut off, but I resolved this by defining each code block, allowing me to print the maps and graphs with a single def line. Overall, I believe I was successful in organizing the presentation format using RISE.
