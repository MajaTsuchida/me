    This is going to be your first 'algorithm' in the usual sense of the word!
    you'll give it a range to guess inside, and then use binary search to home
    in on the actual_number.

    Each guess, print what the guess is. Then when you find the number return
    the number of guesses it took to get there and the actual number
    as a dictionary. make sure that it has exactly these keys:
    {"guess": guess, "tries": tries}

    This will be quite hard, especially hard if you don't have a good diagram!

    Use the VS Code debugging tools a lot here. It'll make understanding
    things much easier.
