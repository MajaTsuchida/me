TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I had some difficulty with Exercise 1, Super Asker, because I placed the {low} and {high} in the wrong lines and positions. I also struggled a lot with the binary search exercise, where i continuously got the error message "binary search() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given." While I'm am still a little confused with this, after trying different approaches and revisiting the binary search page on the Khan Academy website, I gained a deeper understanding of how binary search works. I realized that using the def binary search code in most of my attempts was unnecessary and was able to solve the exercise after this realization.
