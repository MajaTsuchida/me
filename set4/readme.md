TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
It was interesting to understand the input and output process in Exercise 1, where I figured out the answers by referencing their location in LazyDuck. For the first code, once I understood the logic of entering it like a file path, I was able to solve the question, and found it interesting. I encountered several error messages in other tasks, such as "Check if file path is correct" or "return not inside function." However, I eventually resolved these issues by adjusting the code until it worked and communicating with others to find the solutions.
