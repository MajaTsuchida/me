TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week, I had a quiz during class and was able to complete all the questions. I was reminded of the importance of communicating with others, as they can often spot simple mistakes in my code that I missed. I felt that my revision of the previous exercises greatly helped me in answering the quiz questions. Although I encountered difficulties with some of the questions, especially towards the end, and kept getting an error especially on the last question, I eventually realized that I was missing a single line of code, which was causing the issue.
