TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In Week 9, we were introduced to creating maps using Pandas and learned how to represent them in various ways, such as color-coding the map or altering the outlines. This gave me the opportunity to explore how I could present my dataset through maps. For instance, I was particularly interested in figuring out how to color-code the light rail stops based on their popularity. I also continued refining the code from previous Pandas exercises. As I had a quiz on Week 9, I reviewed the exercises, completed any unfinished tasks, and reached out to others for clarification on anything that was unclear such as the binary search that I was confused for a while.
